# BANK-CREDIT-RATING
A banking client provides you with data containing information concerning the credit rating of 4′017 individuals.
􏰨 The client’s primary question is to know whether it is possible to predict ‘credit rating’ (i.e. whether or not an individual is a ‘bad risk’ customer) using the other information in the data.
􏰨 How well can credit rating be detected? What type of decision rule should be used?
